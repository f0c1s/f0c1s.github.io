## From wiki

<pre>
A low-code development platform (LCDP) provides a development environment used to create application software through
a graphical user interface instead of traditional hand-coded computer programming.

A low-coded platform may produce entirely operational applications,
or require additional coding for specific situations.

Low-code development platforms reduce the amount of traditional hand coding,
enabling accelerated delivery of business applications.

A common benefit is that a wider range of people can contribute to the application's developmentâ€”not only those with coding skills.
LCDPs can also lower the initial cost of setup, training, deployment and maintenance.
