<h2>man fping</h2>

<pre><code>fping - send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts

fping is a program like ping which uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request to
determine if a target host is responding.  fping differs from ping in that you can specify any number of
targets on the command line, or specify a file containing the lists of targets to ping.  Instead of
sending to one target until it times out or replies, fping will send out a ping packet and move on to the
next target in a round-robin fashion.  In the default mode, if a target replies, it is noted and removed
from the list of targets to check; if a target does not respond within a certain time limit and/or retry
limit it is designated as unreachable. fping also supports sending a specified number of pings to a
target, or looping indefinitely (as in ping ). Unlike ping, fping is meant to be used in scripts, so its
output is designed to be easy to parse.  Current statistics can be obtained without termination of
process with signal SIGQUIT (^\ from the keyboard on most systems).</code></pre>

<h2 id="options">Options</h2>
<pre class="shell"><code>
-a, --alive
    Show systems that are alive.

-A, --addr
    Display targets by address rather than DNS name. Combined with -d, the output will be both the ip
    and (if available) the hostname.

-q, --quiet
    Quiet. Don&#39;t show per-probe results, but only the final summary. Also don&#39;t show ICMP error
    messages.

-g, --generate addr/mask
    Generate a target list from a supplied IP netmask, or a starting and ending IP.  Specify the netmask
    or start/end in the targets portion of the command line. If a network with netmask is given, the
    network and broadcast addresses will be excluded. ex. To ping the network 192.168.1.0/24, the
    specified command line could look like either:

     $ fping -g 192.168.1.0/24

    or

     $ fping -g 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.254</code></pre>
